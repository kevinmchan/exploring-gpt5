# Exploring GPT5 and Responses API

I'd like to explore OpenAI's python Responses API, including using some of the new features released with GPT5. Given most of OpenAI's current flagship models are being deprecated, I will focus exclusively on features compatable with GPT5 for this exercise.

Here are some scenarios I'd like to document:
- [ ] Generating responses (hello gpt5)
- [ ] Providing developer prompts
- [ ] Getting back reasoning trace
- [ ] Changing reasoning level
- [ ] Tool calls
- [ ] Structured outputs
- [ ] Getting token counts
- [ ] Change verbosity
- [ ] Provide image context
